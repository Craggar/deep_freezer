# Deep Freezer
## Freeze ActiveRecord models to Rails compatible fixtures.

This gem allows you to 'freeze' your ActiveRecord models to Rails compatible fixture files. This allows you to store real data statically for quick start dev/staging evironments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'deep_freezer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install freezer

## Usage

### Config
Be sure to load your freezer classes in `development.rb`
```
Dir.glob(Rails.root.join("lib", "freezers", "*.rb")).each do |file|
  require file
end
```

Create an initializer and set the path for fixtures to be saved

`Freezer::Base.fixture_path = Rails.root.join("test", "fixtures")`

### Define Freezers

Define a `DeepFreezer` for your model

```
class PostFreezer < DeepFreezer::Base

  freeze :id,
         :title,
         :body,
         :created_at,
         :updated_at

end
```

### Perform Freeze

And then write a script to select and freeze the records you want:

```
  posts = Post.all.limit(10)
  posts.map { |p | PostFreezer.new(p).freeze }
```

This will result in a `posts.yml` file in `test/fixtures` which can be loaded by running `rake db:fixtures:load`

### Reset Fixtures

Fixtures can be deleted manually in the directory, or by running `Freezers::Base.reset!`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
